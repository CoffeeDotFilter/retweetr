# Retweetr

Retweetr is a tinder style app for liking and retweeting tweets

### Why?

Because we are learning how to implement Oauth with a 3rd party service, we'll be allowing users to login via their twitter accounts for this app.

### How?

We'll be building Retweetr using:

+ Node.js with Hapi - our server technology
+ Redis - our database
+ Handlebars - to render our views
+ Bcrypt - to encrypt our data
+ Authentication using Oauth2
+ Hammer.js - a gesture library
